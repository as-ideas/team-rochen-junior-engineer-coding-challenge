# Coding Challenge - Backend

## Prerequisites:
- ensure `Node.js` & `npm` are installed
- install dependencies by running `npm install` in the `/backend` directory
- Run `npm run setup` to generate the SQLite database file containing the articles.

## How to run the backed:
- Execute `npm run start`


## Database:

The backend uses [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) and [sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) as library for the SQLite database.

Check the file `initialize-database.js` to see how the database tables are structured.
